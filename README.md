# Getting Started with the Form APP

## Launching Server.

You need two terminals to run this project.
One for the Server and one for the Client

Go first to the `\server` folder and execute the 
command:

### `npm run dev`

This will run the server on the port 8383

## Launching client.

On a different Terminal go to the `root` folder of the
app and run:

### `npm start`

This will launch the browser with the app on port 3000

## Running Tests.

This can also be done in the `root` folder. 
Run the command:

### `npm run test`
