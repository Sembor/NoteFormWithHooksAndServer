# Getting Started with the Form APP

## Launching Server.

You need two terminals to run this project.
One for the Server and one for the Client

Go first to the `\server` folder and execute the command

### `node run dev`

This will run the server on the port 8383

Then on a different Terminal go to the `root` of the
app and run

### `npm start`

This will launch the browser with the app on port 3000
